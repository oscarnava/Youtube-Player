# Course: HTML5 & CSS3
## First microverse project: Youtube clone

This is the second version of the first project for the Microverse training program.
It was developed by Nico and Oscar (the dream team) using basic html tags and CSS styling.

It's a functional copy of this link [Contributing to Open Source Part I: The Easy Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V74l_zS1x8E&feature=youtu.be).
Not every function was exact, but we tried to replicate the structure and the look&feel of the original site.
